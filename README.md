# Generative AI Project

## Overview
This repository hosts the **Generative AI Project**, an innovative project utilizing cutting-edge generative models to create synthetic content such as images, text, or other data formats. The aim is to explore, develop, and share implementations of generative algorithms, leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and specialized libraries for deep learning.

## Features
- **Custom Model Architectures**: Implementations of state-of-the-art generative models such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers.
- **Pre-trained Model Support**: Integration with popular pre-trained models for fine-tuning.
- **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing**: Tools for augmenting datasets to improve training performance.
- **Training Pipeline**: End-to-end training scripts for easy deployment.
- **Interactive Demos**: Notebooks and web applications to showcase model outputs.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Generative-AI-Project.git
    cd Generative-AI-Project
    ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
- **Training a model**:
    ```bash
    python scripts/train_model.py --config configs/model_config.yaml
    ```
- **Generating new content**:
    Run a generation script or a Jupyter notebook provided in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Examples
